# Evolution Simulation

This is a Python-based simulation of a simple ecosystem where **prey** and **predators** evolve over time based on their success in survival and reproduction. Traits like speed, energy efficiency, and vision are encoded in each agent's genes and mutate over generations.

## 🧠 Features

- **Evolving agents** (prey & predators) with gene-based behavior:
  - `speed`, `vision`, `energy_gain`, `energy_loss`, and `reproduce_energy`
- **Energy-based survival and reproduction**
- **Basic plant-prey-predator interaction**
- **Stat tracking** and **live gene evolution graphs**
- **Customizable world settings**

## 📈 Tracked Statistics

![python evolution sim](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a621bba-51ec-493b-b247-d160dd9f2973)

The simulation tracks and plots:

- Population of prey and predators over time
- Average gene values (e.g., speed, vision) for both groups
